# Sales-Profit
I recently developed a comprehensive analytics tool to transform complex sales data into actionable insights. By leveraging advanced Excel techniques—from Pivot Table engines to interactive Slicers—I’ve created a roadmap for growth and operational efficiency.
To create the Sales and Profit Dashboard shown in the video using Microsoft Excel, a multi-step data processing and visualization workflow was executed.
Part 1: Technical Execution in Excel
1. Data Foundation: Cleaned and structured raw transaction data, ensuring standardized formats for accurate currency and date calculations.
2. Analytical Engine: Utilized Pivot Tables and advanced formulas to aggregate key KPIs, including a total revenue of $1.93M.
3. Visual Design: Developed a professional dashboard layout using Pivot Charts (Map, Bar, and Line) while removing gridlines for a clean UI.
4. Dynamic Interactivity: Implemented Slicers for real-time filtering by Category, Year, and Month across all visual elements.
5. Seamless Navigation: Added Hyperlinked Sheets to create an "app-like" experience, allowing users to toggle between the dashboard and raw data instantly.
Part 2: Strategic Business Insights
6. Revenue Growth: Achieved a robust $248K in Total Profit, signaling strong financial health across all categories.
7. Sector Dominance: Identified Technology as the highest-growth sector, with Phones and Chairs leading as top individual products.
8. Geographic Leadership: Validated California as the primary market driver, contributing over $390K in sales.
9. Seasonal Trends: Detected a major performance spike in Q4 (November & December), highlighting the importance of year-end inventory readiness.
10. Future Action Plan: Established a roadmap to scale the Technology sector and optimize low-performing categories like Fasteners to increase overall margins.
